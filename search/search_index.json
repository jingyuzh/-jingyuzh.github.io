This plant is characterized by its seco-prezizaane sesquiterpenes and prenylated C6-C3 compounds. Most plants within this genus are known to be toxic, with many compounds isolated from them exhibiting either neurotrophic or neurotoxic properties.</p> <p>In this project, we delved into the chemical constituents and biological activities found in the roots and stem bark of Illicium brevistylum A.C.Smith. Our approach involved employing TLC, LC-HRMS, and LC-UV guided by the distinctive absorption patterns of seco-prezizaane sesquiterpenes and prenylated C6-C3 compounds. We utilized a comprehensive array of separation methods, such as silica gel column chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, polyamide, macroporous resin, gel, and ODS, to successfully isolate the seco-prezizaane sesquiterpenes and prenylated C6-C3 compounds from Illicium brevistylum A.C.Smith.

L","text":"<p>Jul. 2021</p> <p>Zostera marina L.L is the most widely distributed perennial seagrass along the coast of the Northern Hemisphere. In this study, we investigated the secondary metabolites of Zostera marina L.L and their associated activities. Ethanol extraction was employed with ethyl acetate to yield an extract. This extract was then further processed using ether extraction, resulting in a smaller polar fraction that underwent GC-MS analysis. Subsequently, the larger polar fraction within the extract underwent repeated separation and purification through silica gel column chromatography and thin-layer chromatography. Ultimately, this process yielded two compounds: 3', 4', 5,5', 6,7-hexamethoxyflavone and \u03b2-sitosterol. The compounds' structures were confirmed through MS, NMR, and other spectroscopic techniques. Antioxidant activity was determined via the DPPH method, revealing an EC50 value of 78.54 \u03bcg/ml for the crude extract and an EC50 value of 0.778 mg/ml for 3', 4', 5,5', 6,7-hexamethoxyflavonoid. It can be seen that the crude extract of Zostera marina L. L has good antioxidant activity, and the DPPH clearance rate can reach 90% at a concentration of 150 \u03bcg/ml.</p> <p>This investigation significantly broadens the scope of natural metabolites derived from marine sources. Notably, we conducted the first-ever analysis of the small polar fraction of Zostera marina L.L, identifying a total of 33 compounds and analyzing their relative content. Of particular interest is the polymethoxyflavonoid 3', 4', 5,5', 6,7-hexamethoxyflavonoid, which exhibits rapid and reversible activation of CFTR Cl- channels in a dose-dependent manner. This activation is achieved by increasing cAMP levels and directly binding to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Crucially, among flavonoid compounds, it exhibits the highest affinity as a CFTR Cl- channel activator (EC50 = 2 \u03bcmol/L). Given the vital role of CFTR in fluid transport, water and electrolyte balance, and its close association with conditions like habitual constipation and bronchiectasis, 3', 4', 5,5', 6,7-hexamethoxyflavonoid presents promising potential as a lead compound for CFTR-related disease treatment.</p>"},{"location":"project3/","title":"Project 3","text":""},{"location":"project3/#development-of-a-ginger-weight-loss-biscuit","title":"Development of a Ginger Weight Loss Biscuit","text":"<p>Oct. 2018 \u2013 Sept. 2019</p> <p>Ginger possesses the potential to enhance lipid metabolism and demonstrates a favorable impact on reducing blood lipid levels.

By analyzing the growth characteristics of these bacteria in solutions with varying concentrations of these heavy metal ions, as well as their combined concentrations, we aimed to identify the optimal composition and concentrations of drug components for effectively inhibiting bacterial growth.</p> <p>To begin, we employed techniques such as plate coating and scribing separation to purify the bacterial strains. During the initial experimentation phase, we cultured these strains in the presence of varying concentrations of copper, zinc, and selenium ions. The objective was to ascertain the minimum inhibitory concentration of each ion against the pathogenic bacteria. The results revealed that the minimum inhibitory concentration for zinc ions was 185 mg/L, while for copper ions, it was 58 mg/L. Interestingly, selenium ions exhibited limited bactericidal efficacy even at high concentrations.</p> <p>Consequently, we proceeded to establish a gradient range spanning from 0 to 185 mg/L. Within this range, we organized eight experimental groups alongside a control group. Our analysis encompassed evaluating indicators such as fresh weight, absorbance, and colony count following the bacterial culture. Notably, our findings indicated that copper and selenium ions displayed a stimulatory effect at lower concentrations. This effect, however, was less pronounced in the presence of zinc ions. On the other hand, both copper and selenium ions demonstrated an inhibitory effect at higher concentrations. Additionally, zinc ions exhibited inhibitory properties, albeit this inhibition was counteracted by the stimulatory influence of copper and selenium ions.</p> <p></p>"}]}
